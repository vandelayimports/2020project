    <h1>Code your Ethusiasm</h1>
    <h3><p>Watch ... if you wish “Seinfeld” had more cursing. David plays a slightly sour version of himself with wildly hilarious results. This show set a high-water mark for observational comedy and for lovable jerks pointing out the weird rules that guide all of our relationships. Turn this on when you need to validate all the times you’ve felt irritated by social etiquette and arbitrary rules, or when you want to live vicariously through a character who is the ultimate devil’s advocate.
        Skip ... if cringe-worthy comedy makes you even a little bit uncomfortable. David is the master of putting his foot in his mouth and causing great havoc as a result. Even though it’s a comedy, the relationships are all really intense — infidelity, fighting with co-workers, lying to friends and yelling at strangers are all fair game.</p></h3>
